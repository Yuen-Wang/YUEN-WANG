<ul>
<h4><li>People now rely heavily on digital media and even do not realize that they gradually get lost and out of control when using it. Tiktok can be an example here. People originally just wanted to spend their free time relaxing by using Tiktok, but due to the operation of the big data, people will watch the content that they are interested in endlessly. This phenomenon reflects how social media apps can be as harmful and addictive as cigarettes, drugs, or gambling <a href=" https://pubs-aeaweb-org.sheffield.idm.oclc.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20210867"> (Allcott, Gentzkow, and Song, 2022).</a> Therefore, digital well-being means people can limit the time they spend on digital media and force themselves to stop using digital media. Then, they can better control the uses of social media to achieve higher efficiency in using media.
</li></h4>
</ul>               
	



<ul>
<h4><li>The young generation is losing relationships and only interacting with people through the Internet and social media. For example, Instagram. Their voices become audio, facial expressions become emojis. Therefore, it no longer allows people to shake hands in person and people are taking a break from the fun of real life. Restrictions on digital media brought about by digital well-being give people a chance to reconnect with their friends face-to-face for healthier relationships.</li></h4>
</ul>

<h3><li><b>Conclusion:</b></li></h3>
</ul>
<p>Digital well-being provides a tool that develops people’s satisfaction and happiness in their lives instead of being controlled by digital technologies. It helps people establish better internet habits and norms in digital society, because users are required to manage digital stimuli to effectively direct them to personal goals and subjective well-being <a href=" https://ijse.padovauniversitypress.it/system/files/papers/2017_1_8.pdf"> (Gui, Fasoli, and Carradore, 2017).</a>
